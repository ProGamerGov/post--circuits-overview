            In the original narrative of deep learning, each neuron builds progressively more abstract, meaningful features by composing features in the preceding layer.
            What happens if you take this story really seriously -- spending thousands of hours characterizing the neurons of a single model and tracing their connections?
            The circuits collaboration aims to find out.

        <h2>Articles & Comments</h2>

        <p>
          The natural unit of publication for investigating circuits seems to be short papers on individual circuits or small families of features.
          Compared to normal machine learning papers, this is a small and unusual topic for a paper.
        </p>

        <p>
          To facilitate exploration of this direction, Distill is inviting a “thread” of short articles on circuits,
          interspersed with critical commentary by experts in adjacent fields.
          The thread will be a living document, with new articles added over time,
          organized through an open slack channel (#circuits in the <a href="http://slack.distill.pub">Distill slack</a>).
          Content in this thread should be seen as early stage exploratory research.
        </p>

                  Does it make sense to treat individual neurons and the connections between them as a serious object of study?
                  This essay proposes three claims which, if true, might justify serious inquiry into them:
                  the existence of meaningful features, the existence of meaningful circuits between features, and the universality of those features and circuits.
                  <br><br>
                  It also discuses historical successes of science "zooming in," whether we should be concerned about this research being qualitative, and approaches to rigorous investigation.

          <h2>Get Involved</h2>

          <p>
              The Circuits thread is open to articles exploring individual
              features, circuits, and their organization within neural networks.
              Critical commentary and discussion of existing articles is also welcome.
              The thread is organized through the open <code>#circuits</code> channel on the <a href="slack.distill.pub">Distill slack</a>.
              Articles can be suggested there, and will be included at the discretion of previous authors in the thread,
              or in the case of disagreement by an uninvolved editor.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you would like get involved but don't know where to start,
            small projects may be available if you ask in the channel.
          </p>

          <h2>About the Thread Format</h2>

          <p>
            Part of Distill's mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific publishing.
            We believe that that reconciling faster and more continuous approaches to publication with review and discussion is an important open problem in scientific publishing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Threads are collections of short articles, experiments, and critical commentary around an emerging or unusual research topic.
            They are intended to be less earlier stage than a full Distill paper,
            and allow for more fluid publishing, feedback and interaction on early stage results.
            Thinks a cross  between a Twitter thread, an academic workshop, and a book of  collected essays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Threads are very much an experiment.
            We think it's possible they're a great format, and also possible they're terrible.
            We plan to trial two such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.
